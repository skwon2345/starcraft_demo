Portraits extracted and converted by ACE_Spark.
Portraits have been sorted and renamed according to their final game designation, how-ever the file-names of the portraits themselves remain as they were in the games' files.

Portrait Naming:
id = Idle
tlk = Speaking


Note, the portraits really do use so few colours.
The game gives the impression of a greater colour palette through use of scan lines.
